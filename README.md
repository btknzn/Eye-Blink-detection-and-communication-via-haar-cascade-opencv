# Eye-Blink-detection-and-communication-via-haar-cascade-opencv
The aim of this project detecting blinking number using haar-face-detection and also haar-eye-detection and then countin the blink number and offering user their desired food

You can watch the video of project,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWur3a9eWqY&t=7s. 
The aim of project is detecting eye blinking via using Haarcascade_frontalface and haarcsascade_eye and 
counting the blink numbver via using camera and stating the equivalent number of blink ( 1 blink = elma 2 = armut 3= çilek 4 = muz 5 = ananas 6 = nar 7 =uzum  8 = şeftali 9=kayısı 10 = kiraz)

The user should install numpy cv2 and time library and also install pre trained some models ( haarcascade_frontalgace_fefault.xml and haarcascade_eye.xml).THe information about these library and this pre trained model are enormous,
so this system is easy to use.
Please do not hesitate to ask me for any further information

This systems includes one raspberry pi 3 b plus, one V2.1 raspberry camera, and one 2x16 LCD. I also uploded haarcascade_frontalgace_fefault.xml and haarcascade_eye.xml. If you make research, you can even train your models.
